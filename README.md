DiffusiveFlow
=============

Solving and tracing of power flow using an iterative diffusive approach.

The files **ColorFlowPlotterALL** and **ColorFlowSeries** are the original files from Jacob's project in late 2014.

**diffusive.py** contains the new and improved function. I is called from **solving.py**

**plotting.py** makes figues for each node and link.

**fractionCorrelations.py** calculates correlations of power mixes between the
up/down stream approach and the diffusive flow.
